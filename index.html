        <p class="block indent">The peculiar relation between cute and dragqueens has to be explained. While it’s not true that all dragqueens are, there is no doubt a peculiar
          affinity and overlap. The cute insistence on not being ‘serious’, on playing, also connects with the dragqueens desire to remain youthfull.<p>

        <p class="block indent-big">To me a lot of dragqueens are surely cute, like Kim Chi and Trixie Mattel. But my sister thinks that dragqueens are ‘meer kattig dan schattig’.
          Which I can agree on as well, but I think that it’s because that a more of a caricature of cute and their can also be parts of a queen which are
          cute like the fact that they love to wear bright colours and loads of glitter. Or maybe it’s because dragqueens are always over the top, more
          that a ‘real’ woman. They have too much of everything. It feels a bit as if playing with dolls when I was little, and making up stories of how I
          would be when I grow up (Which never was to realistic). But then the dragqueens became a caricature of those dolls. That sometimes reminds me of
          Disney princesses that are perfectly polished en wear bright colourful glittery gowns just like dragqueens.</p>

        <p class="block indent">One of my favourite and therefore one of the cutest dragqueens is Kim Chi. She is very goofy and clumsy in her way of moving and talking which
          sometimes is a bit child like. Also her looks are always very imaginative, with a lot of bright and pastel colours. She always has really.</p>

        <p class="block indent">big eyes, and big hair, just like an anime character. She definitely has some of that kawaii style in or out of drag and I am not the only one
          who thinks that, a lot of reddit readers agree with me as they respond to a snapchat picture of Kim Chi out of drag. Also the fact that a lot of
          her outfits are kind of inspired by cartoon characters like Tweety or Hello Kitty are cute.</p>

          Another dragqueen that is surely cute is Trixie Mattel. She embodies the character of a barbie doll in a caricature way. Which is probably why
          her last name is Mattel, like the brand that created barbie. More resemblance between Trixie and barbie are that their favourite colour is pink,
          and that they both have blond hair. Her makeup is also very doll like (not the same as barbie, but more in a human doll sort of way). The queen
          said she found inspiration for her makeup in toys that she always wanted to play with as a kid, but that society frowned upon. Which is not very
          traditional makeup for a dragqueen, she also got a some comments on her makeup by other dragqueens. Like Acid Betty, who said: ‘Look at that ugly
          makeup, let’s be honest, That nose contour is atrocious.’ But Trixie is actually not at al bothered by these comments.
        </p>
        <p class="block indent">Overal maybe not all dragqueens are cute, but definitely a lot of elements from dragqueens are cute. And maybe the look of dragqueens is also
          changing, the dragqueens</p>

          This cute innocent look can also be a mask, for example the Japanese artist Yoshitomo Nara paints a lot of young innocent looking girls with big heads
          (also a lot of dogs). Although the children and dogs he creates are adorable they are often ominous, causing viewers to contemplate the feelings and
          concepts behind his work. Underneath the popular appeal of the dark but adorable characters in his work are the somber social, political, and personal
          elements of his work: darker emotions of loneliness in a rigid society, rage, fear, and helplessness. Nara uses soft pastels and the apiece of cute and
          vulnerable children and animals as opposed to punk rock imagery. He also takes inspiration from the positive values of Japanese tradition and combines
          traditional with contemporary. The subjects of his work, the wide-eyed children and animals, whose vulnerability and in addition to the nightmarish
          features of his paintings can easily stimulate distressing feelings. He often uses soft pastel colours with bold lines as seen in anime characters in
          popular culture. The children fea

          It is with his use of contrasting images, colours, and emotions that Nara’s work has captured the imaginations of generations around the world.
